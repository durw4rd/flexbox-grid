# Few flexbox excercises

Three interconnected page views testing some of the flexbox capacities. Project is using Gulp to automate workflow.

- greating 12-column grid and breaking free from it;
- creating page with fixed header/footer and flexible content element;
- creating basic photo album;

For opening the page, clone the repository, enter project folder, run <tt>npm install</tt> and then <tt>gulp</tt>.

Thanks to use of some webkit-only properties, site might look odd in Mozilla.
